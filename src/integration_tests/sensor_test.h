/**
 * @brief Test that sensor init and uninit works as expected.
 *
 * - Sensor must return RD_SUCCESS on first init.
 * - None of the sensor function pointers may be NULL after init
 * - Sensor should return RD_ERROR_INVALID_STATE when initializing sensor which is already init. May return other error if check for it triggers first.
 *   - Sensor structure must be not be altered in failed init.
 *   - This also means that a sensor is "locked" until first successful initializer uninitializes.
 * - Sensor must return RD_SUCCESS on first uninit
 * - All of sensor function pointers must return RD_ERROR_NOT_INITIALIZED after uninit
 * - Sensor configuration is not defined after init, however the sensor must be in lowest-power state available.
 * - Sensor mode_get must return RD_SENSOR_CFG_SLEEP after init.
 * - Sensor configuration is not defined after uninit, however the sensor must be in lowest-power state available.
 *   - Sensor power consumption is not tested by this test.
 * - Sensor initialization must be successful after uninit.
 * - Init and Uninit should return RD_ERROR_NULL if pointer to the sensor struct is NULL. May return other error if check for it triggers first.
